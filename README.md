# OpenCV Python Beginner Tutorial Notebook
This notebook contains an introduction to various concepts/functions used in OpenCV. 

The purpose of this notebook is to include all the basic functions in one place, along with a brief mention of when they should be used, so that beginners can experiment with OpenCV. 

The contents are inspired by the official OpenCV documentation tutorials. Following topics are included in the notebook and are generally used for any computer vision task:

1.	Core operations:

   •	Basic Operations
         - Reading and displaying an image
         - Channels of an image
         - Accessing pixels
         - Image ROI (Region of interest)

2.	Image processing:

   •	Color spaces

   •	Color based object detection and Masking

   •	Thresholding

   •	Smoothing
       - Gaussian blurring
       - Median blurring

   •	Gradients
       - Sobel and Laplacian
   
   •	Canny edge detection

3.	Feature detection and description:

   •	Understanding features

   •	SIFT 

   •	Feature Matching using SIFT

OpenCV version used: 3.3.1

Dependencies: OpenCV, Matplotlib, Numpy
